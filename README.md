# Interactive-Quiz-Ch-04

Application prompts me to answer a series of questions timed on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers


The following user story and acceptance criteria was used for the application's development:

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
